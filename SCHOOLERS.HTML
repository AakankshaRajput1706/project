          Skills such as naming colors, showing affection, and hopping on one foot are called developmental milestones. Developmental milestones are things most children can do by a certain age. Children reach milestones in how they play, learn, speak, behave, and move (like crawling, walking, or jumping).

As children grow into early childhood, their world will begin to open up. They will become more independent and begin to focus more on adults and children outside of the family. They will want to explore and ask about the things around them even more. Their interactions with family and those around them will help to shape their personality and their own ways of thinking and moving. During this stage, children should be able to ride a tricycle, use safety scissors, notice a difference between girls and boys, help to dress and undress themselves, play with other children, recall part of a story, and sing a song..</p>

  Developmental Milestones
  Middle childhood brings many changes in a child’s life. By this time, children can dress themselves, catch a ball more easily using only their hands, and tie their shoes. Having independence from family becomes more important now. Events such as starting school bring children this age into regular contact with the larger world. Friendships become more and more important. Physical, social, and mental skills develop quickly at this time. This is a critical time for children to develop confidence in all areas of life, such as through friends, schoolwork, and sports.
  
  Here is some information on how children develop during middle childhood:

          Following are some of the things you, as a parent, can do to help your preschooler during this time:
Continue to read to your child. Nurture her love for books by taking her to the library or bookstore.
Let your child help with simple chores.
Encourage your child to play with other children. This helps him to learn the value of sharing and friendship.
Be clear and consistent when disciplining your child. Explain and show the behavior that you expect from her. Whenever you tell her no, follow up with what he should be doing instead.
Help your child develop good language skills by speaking to him in complete sentences and using “grown up” words. Help him to use the correct words and phrases.
Help your child through the steps to solve problems when she is upset.
Give your child a limited number of simple choices (for example, deciding what to wear, when to play, and what to eat for snack)..</p>
<h2 class="lead mb-3">          mid schooler(5-8)</h2>
<p>
  Show affection for your child. Recognize her accomplishments.
Help your child develop a sense of responsibility—ask him to help with household tasks, such as setting the table.
Talk with your child about school, friends, and things she looks forward to in the future.
Talk with your child about respecting others. Encourage him to help people in need.
Help your child set her own achievable goals—she’ll learn to take pride in herself and rely less on approval or reward from others.
Help your child learn patience by letting others go first or by finishing a task before going out to play. Encourage him to think about possible consequences before acting.
Make clear rules and stick to them, such as how long your child can watch TV or when she has to go to bed. Be clear about what behavior is okay and what is not okay.
Do fun things together as a family, such as playing games, reading, and going to events in your community.
Get involved with your child’s school. Meet the teachers and staff and get to understand their learning goals and how you and the school can work together to help your child do well.
Continue reading to your child. As your child learns to read, take turns reading to each other.
Use discipline to guide and protect your child, rather than punishment to make him feel bad about himself. Follow up any discussion about what not to do with a discussion of what to do instead.
Praise your child for good behavior. It’s best to focus praise more on what your child does (“you worked hard to figure this out”) than on traits she can’t change (“you are smart”).
Support your child in taking on new challenges. Encourage her to solve problems, such as a disagreement with another child, on her own.
Encourage your child to join school and community groups, such as a team sports, or to take advantage of volunteer opportunities.

          Eat meals with your child whenever possible. Let your child see you enjoying fruits, vegetables, and whole grains at meals and snacks. Your child should eat and drink only a limited amount of food and beverages that contain added sugars, solid fats, or salt.
Keep television sets out of your child’s bedroom. Set limits for screen time for your child to no more than 1 hour per day of quality programming, at home, school, or afterschool care and develop a media use plan for your family.external icon
Provide your child with age-appropriate play equipment, like balls and plastic bats, but let your preschooler choose what to play. This makes moving and being active fun for your preschooler.
Make sure your child gets the recommended amount of sleep each night: For preschoolers 3-5 years, 10–13 hours per 24 hours (including naps)</p>
