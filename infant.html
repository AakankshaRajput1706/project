    Skills such as taking a first step, smiling for the first time, and waving “bye-bye” are called developmental milestones. Developmental milestones are things most children can do by a certain age. Children reach milestones in how they play, learn, speak, behave, and move (like crawling, walking, or jumping).
          
          In the first year, babies learn to focus their vision, reach out, explore, and learn about the things that are around them. Cognitive, or brain development means the learning process of memory, language, thinking, and reasoning. Learning language is more than making sounds (“babble”), or saying “ma-ma” and “da-da”. Listening, understanding, and knowing the names of people and things are all a part of language development. During this stage, babies also are developing bonds of love and trust with their parents and others as part of social and emotional development. The way parents cuddle, hold, and play with their baby will set the 
          basis for how they will interact with them and others.</p>

          Following are some things you, as a parent, can do to help your baby during this time:
          Talk to your baby. She will find your voice calming.
          Answer when your baby makes sounds by repeating the sounds and adding words. This will help him learn to use language.
          Read to your baby. This will help her develop and understand language and sounds.
          Sing to your baby and play music. This will help your baby develop a love for music and will help his brain development.
          Praise your baby and give her lots of loving attention.
          Spend time cuddling and holding your baby. This will help him feel cared for and secure.
          Play with your baby when she’s alert and relaxed. Watch your baby closely for signs of being tired or fussy so that she can take a break from playing.
          Distract your baby with toys and move him to safe areas when he starts moving and touching things that he shouldn’t touch.
          Take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. Parenting can be hard work! It is easier to enjoy your new baby and be a positive, loving parent when you are feeling good yourself.</p>

Breast milk meets all your baby’s needs for about the first 6 months of life. Between 6 and 12 months of age, your baby will learn about new tastes and textures with healthy solid food, but breast milk should still be an important source of nutrition.
Feed your baby slowly and patiently, encourage your baby to try new tastes but without force, and watch closely to see if he’s still hungry.
Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed your baby, but it can be challenging. 
Keep your baby active. She might not be able to run and play like the “big kids” just yet, but there’s lots she can do to keep her little arms and legs moving throughout the day. Getting down on the floor to move helps your baby become strong, learn, and explore.
Try not to keep your baby in swings, strollers, bouncer seats, and exercise saucers for too long.
Limit screen time. For children younger than 18 months of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that it’s best if babies do not use any screen media other than video chatting.
Make sure your child gets the recommended amount of sleep each night: For infants 4-12 months, 12–16 hours per 24 hours (including naps)</p>
